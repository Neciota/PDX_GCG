# PDX_GCG

After cloning the repository to your local disk, ensure you have links on your computer to the HoI4 mod folder with these commands:

`cd "YourPathTo\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\mod"`

`mklink /j "TWC" "YourPathTo\PDX_GCG\HoI4\TWC"`

The .mod file has to be copy-pasted to the HoI4 mods folder, as this cannot be symlinked (apparently), and it is different for everyone anyways.
